    "### Encrypt the EBS Volume – What Happens When You Encrypt an EBS Volume\n",
    "\n",
    "EBS volume encryption helps secure your data by using **AWS-managed or customer-managed keys (KMS)**. When an EBS volume is encrypted, **data at rest, data in transit, and all volume backups (snapshots)** are also encrypted automatically.\n",

    "### What is EBS Encryption?\n",

    "- Encrypts the **data stored on the volume**.\n",
    "- Automatically encrypts:\n",
    "  - **All data at rest**\n",
    "  - **Data in transit between EC2 and EBS**\n",
    "  - **All snapshots** and **volumes created from snapshots**\n",

    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Uses AWS KMS (Key Management Service)**.\n",
    "- No application changes needed — works transparently.\n",

    "1. Go to **EC2 Dashboard > Launch Instance**\n",
    "2. In storage section → Click **Edit EBS Settings**\n",
    "3. Enable **Encryption** and choose a KMS key (or use default)\n",

    "#### Method 2: Copy Unencrypted Snapshot\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to **Snapshots**\n",
    "2. Select unencrypted snapshot → **Actions > Copy Snapshot**\n",
    "3. In the copy settings, enable **Encryption**\n",

    "### Benefits of EBS Encryption\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data security**: Protect sensitive workloads\n",
    "- **Compliance**: Helps meet regulatory standards (e.g., HIPAA, PCI-DSS)\n",
    "- **Simple management**: No manual steps after enabling\n",
    "- **No performance impact**: AWS optimized encryption at hardware level\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- You **cannot directly encrypt an existing volume**.\n",
    "- You need to **create a snapshot and then copy it with encryption**, then create a new volume from that snapshot.\n",
    "- **Encrypted snapshots cannot be shared publicly**.\n",
    "- You **must use KMS keys** when copying or sharing across accounts/regions.\n",
