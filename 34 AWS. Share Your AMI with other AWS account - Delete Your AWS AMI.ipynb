    "AWS allows you to **share your AMIs** with other AWS accounts, and you can also **deregister (delete) an AMI** when itâ€™s no longer needed.\n",

    "### Why Share an AMI?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Team collaboration**: Share pre-configured server setups.\n",
    "- **Multi-account management**: Deploy the same environment in different AWS accounts.\n",
    "- **Backup and disaster recovery**: Use AMIs across different accounts.\n",

    "#### Step 1: Make Sure AMI is Unencrypted\n",
    "- Only **unencrypted AMIs** (or AMIs with customer-managed keys) can be shared easily.\n",
    "- If encrypted, you need to **share the KMS key** too.\n",

    "#### Step 2: Go to AMIs Section\n",
    "- Open AWS Console â†’ **EC2 Dashboard > AMIs**.\n",
    "- Select your AMI.\n",

    "#### Step 3: Modify Permissions\n",
    "- Click **Actions > Modify Image Permissions**.\n",
    "- Choose **Private** sharing.\n",
    "- Add the **AWS Account ID** you want to share with.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Save Changes\n",

    "\n",
    "- Sharing an AMI **does not share associated snapshots** if encrypted.\n",
    "- You must **share the snapshot separately** if required.\n",
    "- If the AMI is public, anyone can access it.\n",
