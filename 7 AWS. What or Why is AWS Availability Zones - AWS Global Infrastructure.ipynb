    "## **What is an AWS Availability Zone (AZ)?**  \n",
    "An **AWS Availability Zone (AZ)** is a **physically separate data center** within an **AWS Region**. Each AZ has **independent power, cooling, and networking** but is connected to other AZs in the same region with **low-latency links**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Do AWS Availability Zones Exist?**  \n",
    "‚úÖ **High Availability** ‚Äì If one AZ fails, others can take over.  \n",
    "‚úÖ **Fault Tolerance** ‚Äì AZs are built to prevent system failures.  \n",
    "‚úÖ **Low Latency** ‚Äì Faster communication between data centers.  \n",

    "- Each **AWS Region** has **at least 3 AZs** (except a few with 2).  \n",
