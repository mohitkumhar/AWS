    "### AWS EC2 Instance\n",
    "An **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)** instance is a virtual server in AWS used to run applications on the cloud. You can choose different instance types based on your needs for computing power, memory, storage, and networking capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance of EC2 Instance Types\n",
    "Different applications require different hardware resources. AWS provides multiple **EC2 instance types** so that you can pick the right one based on your workload and cost requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an Instance Type in AWS?\n",
    "An **instance type** defines the hardware of the host computer used for your instance. It specifies CPU, memory (RAM), storage type, and network performance. AWS groups these into families based on their purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common EC2 Instance Families\n",
    "- **General Purpose (e.g., t4g, t3, m5)**  \n",
    "  Balanced for compute, memory, and networking. Good for web servers, dev environments.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Compute Optimized (e.g., c6g, c5)**  \n",
    "  High-performance processors. Suitable for gaming, batch processing, and scientific modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memory Optimized (e.g., r6g, x2idn)**  \n",
    "  High memory-to-CPU ratio. Best for databases, in-memory caches like Redis or Memcached.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Storage Optimized (e.g., i4i, d3)**  \n",
    "  High-speed storage access. Ideal for large-scale data processing like Hadoop, NoSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accelerated Computing (e.g., p4, inf1, g5)**  \n",
    "  Use GPU or specialized hardware. Great for machine learning, video processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing the Right EC2 Instance\n",
    "Choose based on:\n",
    "- **Workload type**: Web app, database, machine learning, etc.\n",
    "- **Resource need**: More CPU, RAM, storage, or GPU?\n",
    "- **Budget**: Some instances are cheaper but less powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### EC2 Pricing Models\n",
    "- **On-Demand**: Pay per hour/second, no long-term commitment.\n",
    "- **Reserved**: Commit for 1 or 3 years for a lower rate.\n",
    "- **Spot**: Buy unused capacity at a lower price. Good for flexible, fault-tolerant jobs.\n",
    "- **Savings Plans**: Flexible way to save costs across instance families.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instance Size\n",
    "Each instance type comes in sizes like `t3.micro`, `t3.small`, `t3.medium`, etc. Larger sizes mean more vCPUs, RAM, and networking capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases by Instance Type\n",
    "- **t2.micro / t3.micro**: Good for free tier, testing, low-traffic websites.\n",
    "- **c5.large**: Ideal for high-CPU tasks.\n",
    "- **r5.large**: Best for memory-heavy databases.\n",
    "- **p4d**: Use for AI/ML workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Launch an EC2 Instance\n",
    "1. Go to AWS Management Console.\n",
    "2. Choose EC2 > Launch Instance.\n",
    "3. Select an AMI (Amazon Machine Image).\n",
    "4. Choose an instance type.\n",
    "5. Configure instance details, storage, and security group.\n",
    "6. Launch instance and connect via SSH.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monitor Instance Performance\n",
    "Use **Amazon CloudWatch** to monitor CPU usage, memory, disk I/O, and set alarms for auto-scaling or alerts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Upgrade or Change Instance Type\n",
    "Yes, you can **stop the instance**, change the instance type (like from `t2.micro` to `t3.medium`), and **start it again**. This allows flexibility as your needs grow.\n",
    "\n",
