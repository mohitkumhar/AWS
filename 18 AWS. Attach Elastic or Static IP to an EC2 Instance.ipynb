    "### Attach Elastic (Static) IP to an EC2 Instance\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic IP in AWS is a **static, public IPv4 address** that you can assign to your EC2 instance. It allows your instance to have the same public IP even after a reboot or stop/start cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Elastic IP?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Static IP**: Remains the same even if the instance is restarted.\n",
    "- **Reassociation**: Can be easily moved to another instance.\n",
    "- **Useful For**: Web servers, DNS mapping, SSH access with a permanent IP.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Steps to Allocate and Attach an Elastic IP\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Allocate a New Elastic IP\n",
    "1. Go to **AWS Console > EC2 > Network & Security > Elastic IPs**.\n",
    "2. Click **\"Allocate Elastic IP address\"**.\n",
    "3. Choose:\n",
    "   - **Network Border Group** (same as instance’s region)\n",
    "   - Click **\"Allocate\"**\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Associate Elastic IP with EC2 Instance\n",
    "1. Select the newly created Elastic IP.\n",
    "2. Click **\"Actions > Associate Elastic IP address\"**.\n",
    "3. Choose:\n",
    "   - **Instance**: Select the running EC2 instance.\n",
    "   - **Private IP**: Select the default or existing private IP.\n",
    "4. Click **\"Associate\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Verify the Elastic IP\n",
    "- Go to **EC2 > Instances**.\n",
    "- Select your instance and check **Public IPv4 address**.\n",
    "- It should now show the **Elastic IP** you attached.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Releasing an Elastic IP (Optional)\n",
    "If you no longer need the IP:\n",
    "1. Disassociate the Elastic IP from the instance.\n",
    "2. Then select the IP in the Elastic IPs section and click **\"Release\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⚠️ **Note**: AWS charges for unused (unattached) Elastic IPs.\n",

    "- One Elastic IP per instance is **free** (as long as it is attached).\n",
