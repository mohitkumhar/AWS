    "### AWS AMI – Amazon Machine Image – Create Your Own AMI\n",
    "\n",
    "An **AMI (Amazon Machine Image)** is a **pre-configured template** that contains everything needed to launch an EC2 instance, including the operating system, application server, and applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an AMI?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **blueprint** for creating EC2 instances.\n",
    "- Includes:\n",
    "  - Operating system (OS)\n",
    "  - Application server (e.g., Apache, Nginx)\n",
    "  - Custom software or configurations\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Create Your Own AMI?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Faster instance launch** with pre-installed software.\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Launch multiple identical servers easily.\n",
    "- **Backup**: Save the exact state of your machine.\n",
    "- **Disaster Recovery**: Quickly recreate environments if needed.\n",
    "- **Scaling**: Launch many servers with the same setup during load spikes.\n",

    "### Step-by-Step: How to Create Your Own AMI\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Prepare Your EC2 Instance\n",
    "- Launch and set up an EC2 instance.\n",
    "- Install required software and do all configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Create an AMI from the Instance\n",
    "- Go to **EC2 Dashboard > Instances**.\n",
    "- Select your instance → Click **Actions > Image and templates > Create Image**.\n",
    "- Fill details:\n",
    "  - Name\n",
    "  - Description (optional)\n",
    "- Optionally, select storage settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Create Image\n",
    "- Click **Create Image**.\n",
    "- AWS will start creating an AMI (check in **AMIs section**).\n",

    "| Task                  | Outcome                                 |\n",

    "| Save configuration     | All installed applications and settings are saved |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where to Find Your AMI?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Go to **EC2 Dashboard > AMIs** (in the left sidebar).\n",
    "- Your custom AMI will be listed there.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Storage Costs**: AMIs are backed by snapshots, so they will incur S3 storage charges.\n",
    "- **Public/Private**: AMIs are private by default; you can share them with other AWS accounts.\n",
    "- **Regional**: AMIs are region-specific (copy needed to use in another region).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "- Name AMIs clearly with date and version.\n",
    "- Regularly update AMIs if your software stack changes.\n",
    "- Test instances launched from AMI before using them in production.\n",
