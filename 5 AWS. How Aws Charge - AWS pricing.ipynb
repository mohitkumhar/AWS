    "### **AWS Pricing Based on Resource Usage**  \n",
    "\n",
    "AWS pricing is primarily based on three key factors:  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **1️ Compute Pricing**  \n",
    "- AWS charges based on the amount of processing power you use.  \n",
    "- This includes services like **EC2 (Virtual Servers), Lambda (Serverless), and ECS (Containers)**.  \n",
    "- Pricing depends on:  \n",
    "  ✅ **Instance Type** (CPU, RAM, GPU)  \n",
    "  ✅ **Usage Time** (Pay per second/minute/hour)  \n",
    "  ✅ **Region** (Different AWS regions have different prices)  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "- Running an **EC2 instance** for **5 hours** will be charged only for those 5 hours.  \n",
    "- AWS Lambda charges based on **execution time** and **number of requests**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2️ Storage Pricing**  \n",
    "- Charges for the amount of data stored in AWS.  \n",
    "- Includes services like **S3 (Object Storage), EBS (Block Storage), and Glacier (Cold Storage)**.  \n",
    "- Pricing depends on:  \n",
    "  ✅ **Storage Type** (Standard, Infrequent Access, Archive)  \n",
    "  ✅ **Storage Size** (GBs or TBs stored per month)  \n",
    "  ✅ **Data Retrieval Speed** (Faster retrieval costs more)  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "- Storing **100GB** in **S3 Standard** costs more than **S3 Glacier**, which is meant for archival storage.  \n",
    "- If you **store 500GB in S3**, you pay for 500GB/month.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3️ Data Transfer Pricing**  \n",
    "- AWS charges for data moving in and out of its servers.  \n",
    "- **Inbound data (upload to AWS)** is usually **free**, but **outbound data (download from AWS)** is charged.  \n",
    "- Pricing depends on:  \n",
    "  ✅ **Data Transfer Type** (Internet vs. AWS services)  \n",
    "  ✅ **Data Volume** (More data = higher cost)  \n",
    "  ✅ **Region** (Different AWS regions have different transfer costs)  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "- Uploading **1TB** to S3 is free, but **downloading 1TB** to your local system may cost based on AWS pricing.  \n",
    "- Transferring data **between AWS regions** costs extra.  \n",
    "\n",
