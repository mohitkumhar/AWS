    "### Detach and Release Elastic (Static) IP in AWS\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic IPs (EIP) are public static IP addresses provided by AWS. If you no longer need an EIP, you should **detach it from the EC2 instance** and **release it** to avoid unnecessary charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Detach and Release Elastic IP?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cost Saving**: AWS charges for unused (unattached) Elastic IPs.\n",
    "- **Clean Resource Management**: Prevents resource wastage.\n",
    "- **Free Up IPs**: Makes IPs available for other instances or users.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Disassociate (Detach) Elastic IP from EC2\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to **AWS Console > EC2 > Elastic IPs**.\n",
    "2. Select the **Elastic IP** you want to detach.\n",
    "3. Click **\"Actions\" > \"Disassociate Elastic IP address\"**.\n",
    "4. Confirm the disassociation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Release the Elastic IP\n",
    "\n",
    "1. After disassociation, the IP becomes \"Not associated\".\n",
    "2. Select the same Elastic IP.\n",
    "3. Click **\"Actions\" > \"Release Elastic IP address\"**.\n",
    "4. Confirm the release.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⚠️ **Warning**: Once released, you may not get the same IP again.\n",

    "### When Should You Release an EIP?\n",
    "\n",
    "- When the instance using it is terminated or no longer needs a static IP.\n",
    "- To avoid **charges** for unused Elastic IPs.\n",

    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Only allocate Elastic IPs when necessary**.\n",
    "- **Release immediately** when not in use.\n",
    "- **Use DNS** (like Route 53) instead of hardcoding IPs when possible.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Final Note\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each AWS account gets a limited number of EIPs per region (default: 5).\n",
    "- AWS **does not charge** for **one attached** Elastic IP per instance.\n",
    "- Charges apply if:\n",
    "  - The IP is **not associated** with any running instance.\n",
    "  - You have **more than one EIP** attached to the same instance.\n"
