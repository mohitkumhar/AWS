    "### Delete EBS Snapshot – Cleanup Snapshot\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, you might have many EBS snapshots that take up space and cost money. **Deleting EBS snapshots** helps you **clean up old backups and save storage costs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an EBS Snapshot?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **backup of an EBS volume** stored in Amazon S3 (managed by AWS).\n",
    "- Useful for restoring volumes, migrating data, or creating AMIs.\n",
    "- Snapshots **accumulate over time** if not managed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Delete EBS Snapshots?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Save storage costs** (you pay for each GB stored).\n",
    "- **Remove outdated or unnecessary backups**.\n",
    "- **Maintain a clean environment** by keeping only needed backups.\n",

    "### Step-by-Step: How to Delete an EBS Snapshot\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Open EC2 Console\n",
    "- Go to **AWS Management Console** → **EC2 Dashboard** → **Snapshots**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Select Snapshot\n",
    "- Find the snapshot you want to delete.\n",
    "- Select the checkbox next to it.\n",

    "#### Step 3: Delete\n",
    "- Click **Actions > Delete Snapshot**.\n",
    "- Confirm the deletion.\n",

    "### Important Notes Before Deleting\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Check dependencies**:\n",
    "  - If an AMI (Amazon Machine Image) is using the snapshot, **deleting it can affect AMI functionality**.\n",
    "  - If other snapshots are created using this snapshot (incremental), AWS manages the underlying storage automatically.\n",
    "- **Encrypted Snapshots**:\n",
    "  - Deleting encrypted snapshots works the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices for Cleanup\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tag snapshots** when creating them (e.g., with dates or project names).\n",
    "- **Regularly review** old snapshots.\n",
    "- Use **Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM)** to automate snapshot deletion.\n",
    "- Keep at least **one recent backup** before deleting.\n",
