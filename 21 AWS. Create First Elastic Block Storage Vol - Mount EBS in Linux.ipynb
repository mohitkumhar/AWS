    "### Elastic Block Store (EBS) vs Instance Store in AWS\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS provides two main types of storage for EC2 instances: **Elastic Block Store (EBS)** and **Instance Store**. Both serve different purposes depending on your storage needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is EBS (Elastic Block Store)?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Persistent block storage that can be attached to EC2 instances.\n",
    "- **Survives Stop/Start**: Data remains even after the instance is stopped or restarted.\n",
    "- **Detachable**: Can be detached and attached to other instances.\n",
    "- **Snapshot Support**: You can take backups (snapshots) anytime.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of EBS\n",
    "- Persistent storage\n",
    "- Can choose from different volume types: `gp3`, `io2`, `sc1`, etc.\n",
    "- Resize, encrypt, and back up volumes easily\n",
    "- Good for databases, OS storage, and critical data\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Instance Store?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Temporary storage that is physically attached to the host.\n",
    "- **Data Loss on Stop/Terminate**: Data is lost when instance is stopped or terminated.\n",
    "- **High IOPS**: Fast read/write but **not persistent**.\n",
    "- **Cannot be detached** or re-used.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of Instance Store\n",
    "- Temporary storage tied to the instance lifecycle\n",
    "- Very fast (low latency)\n",
    "- Ideal for cache, buffer, or temporary files\n",
    "- No snapshot or backup support\n",
