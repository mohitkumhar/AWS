    "### Attach One EBS Volume to Multiple EC2 Instances\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, **EBS volumes can only be attached to one EC2 instance at a time**. However, AWS provides a special volume type called **EBS Multi-Attach**, which allows you to attach a single EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances **simultaneously**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Multi-Attach?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Useful for applications that need shared access to the same data.\n",
    "- Enables high availability setups (e.g., clustered databases or file systems).\n",
    "- Avoids data duplication across instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations of Multi-Attach\n",
    "\n",
    "- Only works with **io1** and **io2** volume types.\n",
    "- Only **Nitro-based EC2 instances** support Multi-Attach (e.g., `m5`, `c5`, `r5`).\n",
    "- **Must be in the same Availability Zone (AZ)**.\n",
    "- File system must support shared access (e.g., **cluster-aware FS** like GFS2, OCFS2).\n",
    "- Not recommended for standard file systems like ext4 or xfs (risk of data corruption).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step: Enable and Use Multi-Attach\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Create a Multi-Attach Enabled Volume\n",
    "1. Go to **EC2 > Volumes > Create Volume**.\n",
    "2. Choose:\n",
    "   - **Volume Type**: `io1` or `io2`\n",
    "   - **Enable Multi-Attach**: ✅ Check the box\n",
    "   - Choose same **AZ** as your instances\n",
    "3. Click **Create Volume**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Attach the Volume to Multiple EC2 Instances\n",
    "1. Select the volume > **Actions > Attach Volume**\n",
    "2. Choose the first instance, set device name (e.g., `/dev/sdf`) > Attach\n",
    "3. Repeat the process for other EC2 instances in the same AZ\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Configure Shared File System (Important!)\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⚠️ DO NOT use ext4 or xfs without clustering support — this will cause **data corruption**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, use:\n",
    "- **GFS2 (Global File System 2)**\n",
    "- **OCFS2 (Oracle Cluster File System)**\n",
    "- Or manage access at the application level (e.g., databases with built-in clustering)\n",
    "\n",

    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "- Only use **Multi-Attach** when truly needed.\n",
    "- Choose a **cluster-aware file system** to avoid data corruption.\n",
    "- Set up proper **synchronization and locking** at the application or OS level.\n",
    "- Monitor disk usage and performance using **CloudWatch**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Standard use-case**: Most applications should stick to **one EBS volume per instance**.\n",
    "- For **high availability/shared access**, Multi-Attach is powerful but requires careful setup.\n"
