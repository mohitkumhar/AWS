    "### How to Resize ROOT EBS Volume in AWS\n",
    "\n",
    "The **root EBS volume** is where the operating system (OS) of your EC2 instance is installed. You can **increase its size** if your instance is running out of space on the root disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Resize the Root Volume?\n",
    "\n",
    "- EC2 instance shows low disk space (e.g., full `/` directory).\n",
    "- You need more room to install software or store logs.\n",
    "- Want to improve performance by upgrading volume size or type.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Modify the Root Volume from AWS Console\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to **EC2 > Volumes**.\n",
    "2. Find the **root volume** (look under \"Root device\" in instance details).\n",
    "3. Select it and click **Actions > Modify Volume**.\n",
    "4. Enter the new **Size** (larger than current).\n",
    "5. Click **Modify** and confirm.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ðŸ“Œ No need to stop the instance for most modern Linux distros.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Check Disk in EC2 Instance\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "lsblk\n",
    "```\n",
    "This shows attached disks and their sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Resize the Partition and File System\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For ext4 File System (e.g., Ubuntu):\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo growpart /dev/xvda 1\n",
    "sudo resize2fs /dev/xvda1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For xfs File System (e.g., Amazon Linux 2):\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo growpart /dev/xvda 1\n",
    "sudo xfs_growfs -d /\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Confirm the Size Increase\n",
    "\n",
    "Check using:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "df -h\n",
    "```\n",
    "This shows disk usage and available space. You should now see the increased size on root (`/`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- This process **does not delete data** on the root volume.\n",
    "- You **can resize while instance is running** (no reboot needed for most OS).\n",
    "- Works only for **increasing size**, not shrinking.\n",

    "- Always take a **snapshot backup** before resizing.\n",
