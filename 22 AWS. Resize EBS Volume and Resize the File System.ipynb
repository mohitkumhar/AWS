    "### Resize EBS Volume and Resize the File System in AWS\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS allows you to **resize (expand)** an EBS volume even after the EC2 instance is launched. But to use the extra space, you also need to **resize the file system** inside the instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Resize an EBS Volume?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Need more storage space for your application or database.\n",
    "- Performance improvements (for some volume types).\n",
    "- Easily scalable without stopping the instance (for most cases).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Modify the EBS Volume from AWS Console\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to **EC2 > Volumes**.\n",
    "2. Select your EBS volume (attached to the EC2 instance).\n",
    "3. Click **Actions > Modify Volume**.\n",
    "4. Enter new **Size** (larger than current size).\n",
    "5. Click **Modify** and confirm.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ðŸ“Œ You can increase size, IOPS, or volume type from here.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Check Volume Size Inside EC2 Instance\n",
    "\n",
    "For Linux instances:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "lsblk\n",
    "```\n",
    "This shows block devices and their sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Resize the File System\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For ext4 File System (most common on Linux):\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo growpart /dev/xvda 1\n",
    "sudo resize2fs /dev/xvda1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For xfs File System (Amazon Linux 2 and newer):\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo growpart /dev/xvda 1\n",
    "sudo xfs_growfs -d /\n",
    "```\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Verify New Size\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "df -h\n",
    "```\n",
    "This shows updated disk usage and available space.\n",

    "### Notes\n",
    "- You **canâ€™t shrink** EBS volumes â€” only expand.\n",
    "- Resize does **not cause data loss**, but still take a **snapshot** before resizing.\n",
    "- For Windows EC2, use **Disk Management** to extend the volume after resizing in AWS.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "- Always create a **snapshot backup** before modifying volumes.\n",
    "- After resizing, **monitor performance** to ensure it's meeting expectations.\n",
    "- Resize during **low-traffic hours** for production systems if possible.\n"
